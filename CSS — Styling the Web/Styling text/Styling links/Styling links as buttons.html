<!-- Note: You may have noticed that the list items in the HTML are all put on the same line as each other â€” this is done because spaces/line breaks in between inline block elements create spaces on the page, just like the spaces in between words, and such spaces would break our horizontal navigation menu layout. So we've removed the spaces. You can find more information about this problem (and solutions) at Fighting the space between inline block elements. -->
