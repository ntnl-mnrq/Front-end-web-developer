    <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

    <p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>

    <p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
        may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
        had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
        this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
        predator â€” Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
        occasion such as this that he did.</p>
