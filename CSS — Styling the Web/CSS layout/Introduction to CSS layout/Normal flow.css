/* Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout.  

 Note here how the HTML is displayed in the exact order in which it appears in the source code, with elements stacked up on top of one another  
 
The elements that appear one below the other are described as block elements, in contrast to inline elements, which appear one beside the other, like the individual words in a paragraph.

Note: The direction in which block element contents are laid out is described as the Block Direction. 
The Block Direction runs vertically in a language such as English, which has a horizontal writing mode. It would run horizontally in any language with a Vertical Writing Mode, such as Japanese.
 The corresponding Inline Direction is the direction in which inline contents (such as a sentence) would run.


 The methods that can change how elements are laid out in CSS are as follows:

    The display property — Standard values such as block, inline or inline-block can change how elements behave in normal flow, for example making a block-level element behave like an inline element (see Types of CSS boxes for more information). We also have entire layout methods that are switched on via specific display values, for example CSS Grid and Flexbox, which alter how elements inside the element they are set on are laid out.
    Floats — Applying a float value such as left can cause block level elements to wrap alongside one side of an element, like the way images sometimes have text floating around them in magazine layouts.
    The position property — Allows you to precisely control the placement of boxes inside other boxes. static positioning is the default in normal flow, but you can cause elements to be laid out differently using other values, for example always fixed to the top of the browser viewport.
    Table layout — features designed for styling the parts of an HTML table can be used on non-table elements using display: table and associated properties.
    Multi-column layout — The Multi-column layout properties can cause the content of a block to layout in columns, as you might see in a newspaper.


    The display property

The main methods of achieving page layout in CSS are all values of the display property. This property allows us to change the default way something displays. Everything in normal flow has a value of display, used as the default way that elements they are set on behave. For example, the fact that paragraphs in English display one below the other is due to the fact that they are styled with display: block. If you create a link around some text inside a paragraph, that link remains inline with the rest of the text, and doesn’t break onto a new line. This is because the <a> element is display: inline by default.

You can change this default display behavior. For example, the <li> element is display: block by default, meaning that list items display one below the other in our English document. If we change the display value to inline they now display next to each other, as words would do in a sentence. The fact that you can change the value of display for any element means that you can pick HTML elements for their semantic meaning, without being concerned about how they will look. The way they look is something that you can change.

In addition to being able to change the default presentation by turning an item from block to inline and vice versa, there are some bigger layout methods that start out as a value of display. However, when using these, you will generally need to invoke additional properties. The two values most important for our purposes when discussing layout are display: flex and display: grid.
