/* Multi-column layout

The multi-column layout module gives us a way to lay out content in columns, similar to how text flows in a newspaper. While reading up and down columns is less useful in a web context as you donâ€™t want to force users to scroll up and down, arranging content into columns can be a useful technique. */

/* To turn a block into a multicol container we use either the column-count property, which tells the browser how many columns we would like to have, or the column-width property, which tells the browser to fill the container with as many columns of at least that width. */

/* We are using a column-width of 200 pixels on that container, causing the browser to create as many 200-pixel columns as will fit in the container and then share the remaining space between the created columns. */
.container {
  column-width: 200px;
}
