/* Floats

Floating an element changes the behavior of that element and the block level elements that follow it in normal flow. The element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the surrounding content floats around the floated item. */


/* In the example below we float a <div> left, and give it a margin on the right to push the text away from the element. This gives us the effect of text wrapped around that box, and is most of what you need to know about floats as used in modern web design. */

    float: left;
