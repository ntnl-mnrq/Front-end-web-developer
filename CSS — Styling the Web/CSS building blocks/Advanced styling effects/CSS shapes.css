/* CSS shapes

While it is true that everything in CSS is a rectangular box, and images are a physical rectangular box, we can make it look as if our content flows around non-rectangular things by using CSS Shapes.

The CSS Shapes specification enables the wrapping of text around a non-rectangular shape. It's especially useful when working with an image which has some white-space you might want to float text around. */


/* In the image below we have a pleasingly round balloon. The actual file is rectangular, but by floating the image (shapes only apply to floated elements) and using the shape-outside property with a value of circle(50%), we can give the effect of the text following the line of the balloon. */
img {
  float: left;
  shape-outside: circle(50%);
}

/* The shape in this example is not reacting to the content of the image file. Instead, the circle function is taking its centre point from the centre of the image file, as if we had put a compass in the middle of the file and drawn a circle that fits inside the file. It is that circle that the text flows around.

Note: In Firefox you can use the DevTools Shapes Inspector to inspect Shapes.
