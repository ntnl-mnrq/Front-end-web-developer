/* The adjacent sibling selector (+) is used to select something if it is 
right next to another element at the same level of the hierarchy. */

/* A common use case is to do something with a paragraph that follows a heading, 
as in my example below. Here we are looking for a paragraph which is directly
adjacent to an <h1>, and styling it.

If you insert some other element such as a <h2> in between the <h1> and the <p>, 
you will find that the paragraph is no longer matched by the selector and so does 
not get the background and foreground color applied when the element is adjacent. */

    padding: .5em;
