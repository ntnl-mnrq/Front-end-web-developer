/* The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space ( ) character — combines 
two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an 
ancestor (parent, parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc) element matching the first 
selector. Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors. */
