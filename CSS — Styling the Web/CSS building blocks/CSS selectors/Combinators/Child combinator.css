/* The child combinator (>) is placed between two CSS selectors. It matches only 
those elements matched by the second selector that are the direct children of 
elements matched by the first. Descendent elements further down the hierarchy don't match. */

/* In this next example, we have an unordered list, nested inside of which is an ordered list. 
I am using the child combinator to select only the <li> elements which are a direct child of a 
<ul>, and have given them a top border.

If you remove the > that designates this as a child combinator, you end up with a descendant 
selector and all <li> elements will get a red border. */
