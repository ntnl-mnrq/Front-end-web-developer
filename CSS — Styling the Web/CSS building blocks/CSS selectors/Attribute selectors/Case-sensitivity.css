/* If you want to match attribute values case-insensitively you can use the value i before the closing bracket. 
This flag tells the browser to match ASCII characters case-insensitively. Without the flag the values will be 
matched according to the case-sensitivity of the document language — in HTML's case it will be case sensitive.

In the example below, the first selector will match a value that begins with a — it only matches the first list 
item because the other two list items start with an uppercase A. The second selector uses the case-insensitive 
flag and so matches all of the list items. */

li[class^="a"] {
    background-color: yellow;

li[class^="a" i] {
    color: red;
