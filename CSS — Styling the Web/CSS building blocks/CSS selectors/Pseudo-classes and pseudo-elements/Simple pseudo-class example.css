/*  If we wanted to make the first paragraph in an article larger and bold, we could 
add a class to that paragraph and then add CSS to that class. */
/* However, this could be annoying to maintain — what if a new paragraph got added to 
the top of the document? We'd need to move the class over to the new paragraph. Instead 
of adding the class, we could use the :first-child pseudo-class selector — this will 
always target the first child element in the article, and we will no longer need to edit 
the HTML (this may not always be possible anyway, maybe due to it being generated by a CMS.) */

article p:first-child {
    font-size: 120%;
    font-weight: bold;

}  


/* Note: It is valid to write pseudo-classes and elements without any element selector
 preceding them. In the example above, you could write :first-child and the rule would 
 apply to any element that is the first child of an <article> element, not just a 
 paragraph first child — :first-child is equivalent to *:first-child. However, usually 
you want more control than that, so you need to be more specific. */
