/* A writing mode in CSS refers to whether the text is running horizontally or vertically. 
The writing-mode property lets us switch from one writing mode to another. You don't need 
to be working in a language which uses a vertical writing mode to want to do this — you 
could also change the writing mode of parts of your layout for creative purposes. */

/* The three possible values for the writing-mode property are:

    *horizontal-tb: Top-to-bottom block flow direction. Sentences run horizontally.
    *vertical-rl: Right-to-left block flow direction. Sentences run vertically.
    *vertical-lr: Left-to-right block flow direction. Sentences run vertically.

So the writing-mode property is in reality setting the direction in which block-level elements 
are displayed on the page — either from top-to-bottom, right-to-left, or left-to-right. This
then dictates the direction text flows in sentences. */
