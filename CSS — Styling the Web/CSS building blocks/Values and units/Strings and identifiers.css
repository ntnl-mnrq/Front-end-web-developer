/* Strings and identifiers

Throughout the examples above, we've seen places where keywords are used as a value (for example <color> keywords like red, black, rebeccapurple, and goldenrod). These keywords are more accurately described as identifiers, a special value that CSS understands. As such they are not quoted â€” they are not treated as strings.

There are places where you use strings in CSS. For example when specifying generated content. In this case, the value is quoted to demonstrate that it is a string. In the below example we use unquoted color keywords along with a quoted generated content string. */

.box {
    width:400px;
    padding: 1em;
    border-radius: .5em;
    border: 5px solid rebeccapurple;
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
  
  .box::after {
    content: "This is a string. I know because it is quoted in the CSS."
