      // In our code we define the constructor, then we create an instance object from the constructor, then we add a new method to the constructor's prototype:
      Person.prototype.farewell = function() {
        alert(`${this.name.first} has left th building. Bye for now!`);
      }
      // But the farewell() method is still available on the person1 object instance â€” its members have been automatically updated to include the newly defined farewell() method.

      // person1.farewell();

      // Note: Conversely, deleting properties defined on the constructor's prototype using the delete operator removes the respective properties from all other class instances too.

// In the above example, performing delete person1.__proto__.farewell or delete Person.prototype.farewell would remove the farewell() method from all Person instances.

// In order to mitigate this issue, you could use Object.defineProperty() instead.

// You will rarely see properties defined on the prototype property, because they are not very flexible when defined like this.

// In fact, a fairly common pattern for more object definitions is to define the properties inside the constructor, and the methods on the prototype. This makes the code easier to read, as the constructor only contains the property definitions, and the methods are split off into separate blocks.
