    <h2>Resolution switching: Different sizes</h2>

    <code>srcset</code></strong> defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size
    each image is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by<strong> </strong>a comma. For
    each one, we write:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>An <strong>image filename</strong> (<code>elva-fairy-480w.jpg</code>)</li>
        <li>A space</li>
        <li>The image's <strong>intrinsic width in pixels</strong> (<code>480w</code>) — note that this uses the
            <code>w</code> unit, not <code>px</code> as you might expect. This is the image's real size, which can be
            found by inspecting the image file on your computer (for example, on a Mac you can select the image in
            Finder and press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> to bring up the info screen).</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong><code>sizes</code></strong> defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what
        image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true — these are the hints we talked about
        earlier. In this case, before each comma we write:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>A <strong>media condition</strong> (<code>(max-width:600px)</code>) — you'll learn more about these in the
            <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">CSS topic</a>, but for now let's just say that a media condition describes a
            possible state that the screen can be in. In this case, we are saying "when the viewport width is 600 pixels
            or less".</li>
        <li>A space</li>
        <li>The <strong>width of the slot</strong> the image will fill when the media condition is true
            (<code>480px</code>)</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: For the slot width, you may provide an absolute length (<code>px</code>,
            <code>em</code>) or a length relative to the viewport (<code>vw</code>), but not percentages. You may have
            noticed that the last slot width has no media condition (this is the default that is chosen when none of the
            media conditions are true). The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful
            how you order the media conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <p>So, with these attributes in place, the browser will:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Look at its device width.</li>
        <li>Work out which media condition in the <code>sizes</code> list is the first one to be true.</li>
        <li>Look at the slot size given to that media query.</li>
        <li>Load the image referenced in the <code>srcset</code> list that has the same size as the slot or, if there
            isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Older browsers that don't support these features will just ignore them. Instead, those browsers will go ahead and
        load the image referenced in the src attribute as normal.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: In the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
        of the example linked above, you'll find the
        line&nbsp;<code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</code>: this forces mobile browsers to
        adopt their real viewport width for loading web pages (some mobile browsers lie about their viewport width, and
        instead load pages at a larger viewport width then shrink the loaded page down, which is not very helpful for
        responsive images or design).</p>


    <h3 id="Art_direction">Art direction</h3>

    <p>To recap, the <strong>art direction problem</strong> involves wanting to change the image displayed to suit
        different image display sizes. </p>

    <p>Let's fix this, with <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"
            title="The HTML <picture> element contains zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to offer 
                alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios."><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a>!
        Like <a
            href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
            and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code></a>, the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element is a wrapper containing several
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source" title="The HTML <source> element specifies multiple media resources 
            for the <picture>, the <audio> element, or 
                the <video> element."><code>&lt;source&gt;</code></a>
        elements that provide different sources for the browser to choose from, followed by the all-important <a
            href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"
            title="The HTML <img> element embeds an image into the document."><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a> element.</p>

    <pre>&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva"&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;</pre>

    <ul>
        <li>The <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements include a <code>media</code> attribute that contains a media
            condition — as with the first <code>srcset</code> example, these conditions are tests that decide which
            image is shown — the first one that returns true will be displayed. In this case, if the viewport width is
            799px wide or less, the first <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element's image will be displayed. If the viewport
            width is 800px or more, it'll be the second one.</li>
        <li>The <code>srcset</code> attributes contain the path to the image to display. Just as we saw with
            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> above, <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> can take a <code>srcset</code> attribute with
            multiple images referenced, as well as a <code>sizes</code> attribute. So, you could offer multiple images
            via a <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element, but then also offer multiple resolutions of each one.
            Realistically, you probably won't want to do this kind of thing very often.</li>
        <li>In all cases, you must provide an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, with <code>src</code> and
            <code>alt</code>, right before <code>&lt;/picture&gt;</code>, otherwise no images will appear. This provides
            a default case that will apply when none of the media conditions return true (you could actually remove the
            second <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element in this example), and a fallback for browsers that don't support
            the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This code allows us to display a suitable image on both wide screen and narrow screen displays.</p>

    <p>Note: You should use the media attribute only in art direction scenarios; when you do use media, don't also offer
        media conditions within the sizes attribute.</p>

    <h3 >Why can't we just do this using CSS or JavaScript?</h3>

    <p>When the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download&nbsp;(preload) any images before the main parser
        has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. That mechanism is useful in general for
        reducing page load times, but it is not helpful for responsive images — hence the need to implement solutions
        like <code>srcset</code>. For example, you couldn't load the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, then
        detect the viewport width with JavaScript, and then dynamically change the source image to a smaller one if
        desired. By then, the original image would already have been loaded, and you would load the small image as well,
        which is even worse in responsive image terms.</p>
