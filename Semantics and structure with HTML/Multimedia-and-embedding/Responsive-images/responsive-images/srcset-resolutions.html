  <h3 id="Resolution_switching_Same_size_different_resolutions">Resolution switching: Same size, different resolutions
  </h3>

  <p>If you're supporting multiple display resolutions, but everyone sees your image at the same real-world size on the
    screen, you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using <code>srcset</code> with
    x-descriptors and without <code>sizes</code> — a somewhat easier syntax!

  <p>In this example, the following CSS is applied
    to the image so that it will have a width of 320 pixels on the screen (also called CSS pixels):</p>

  <code>img { <br>
  width: 320px; <br>
}</code>

  <p> In this case, <code>sizes</code> is not needed — the browser simply works out what resolution the display is that
    it is being shown on, and serves the most appropriate image referenced in the <code>srcset</code>. So if the device
    accessing the page has a standard/low resolution display, with one device pixel representing each CSS pixel, the
    <code>elva-fairy-320w.jpg</code> image will be loaded (the 1x is implied, so you don't need to include it.) If the
    device has a high resolution of two device pixels per CSS pixel or more, the <code>elva-fairy-640w.jpg</code> image
    will be loaded. The 640px image is 93KB, whereas the 320px image is only 39KB.</p>
