    <!-- A figure doesn't have to be an image. It is an independent unit of content that:

      Expresses your meaning in a compact, easy-to-grasp way.
      Could go in several places in the page's linear flow.
      Provides essential information supporting the main text.

    A figure could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or something else. -->

  <!-- if an image has meaning, in terms of your content, you should use an HTML image. 
  If an image is purely decoration, you should use CSS background images. -->
